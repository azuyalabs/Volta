_Note: The Success Rate metric is not real-time, meaning that completed/failed print jobs in the background are not immediately reflected. You can refresh the Success Rate by clicking on the little circle icon in the top right hand corner._

###2. Heat Map
A different way of seeing what day of the week or month of the year you print the most (or the least) is presented by the heat map. Hovering over the map shows you little more details about the number of print jobs that day.
