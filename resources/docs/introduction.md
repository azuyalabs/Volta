#Introduction

Volta Dashboard is a real-time online dashboard for your 3D printers. (Actually it willl be more than just a dashboard...) It displays the current (printing) status of all of your OctoPrint connected 3D Printers that are paired with the Dashboard. All in one easy overview, and with other handy information as well.

####'Where is it'?
A dashboard of some sorts was an idea I had on my mind for a while as I was frustrated looking for information in so many places. 
'Is there a new version of the Prusa MK3 firmware yet?', 'Is Cura 3.6 already released?', 'When will this print be ready?' are some of the questions that require me to start Google or open multiple OctoPrint tabs.

####Dashboard
And so Volta Dashboard was born! At the moment it is a prototype; a working one albeit a bit rough around the edges. The dashboard consists of 15 tiles (5 x 3 grid) that each can hold a widget. Widgets that are developed so far are:

- OctoPrint: Shows the current status of your printjob/printer (this works by means of a custom OctoPrint plugin) 
- Slicer Releases: Displays the latest release versions of the major slicers
- Firmware Releases: Displays the latest release versions of the most common 3D printer firmwares
- Holidays: Upcoming holidays (in case I need to prepare printing some seasonal gifts/toys)
- Current weather: Just for fun :)
- Clock: Well, what would we be doing without the time...
